      <p class="aboutmep">
        Hello! <br />
        My name is Anaiah Simons and I was born and raised in Redlands, CA. As a
        kid I thought I would become a ballerina and that was really my only
        plan in life. I didn't really think too much about where I wanted my
        life to go and I think it was because I wanted to be a part of so many
        different things. Thanks to my parents, I was immersed into a wide range
        of opportunities at a young age. I jumped into dance classes and theatre
        at just 3 years old. Next came modeling, vocal coaching, and piano
        lessons. Shortly after, I was a part of the classical and show choir for
        all 4 years of high school. Finally, I was enrolled at the American
        Musical and Dramatic Academy at 18 years old and graduated with a BFA in
        Dance Theatre in 2016. I have officially lived in Los Angeles for 8
        years in October of 2021. I guess you could say I was meant to end up
        here. Rightfully so, my parents and their parents were all part of the
        arts at some point and the legacy still continues. I am incredibly
        grateful to be born into a family who believes in the arts
        whole-heartedly and has lived in it and experienced it themselves.
      </p>
      <p class="aboutmep2">
        I am now a photographer and have been for about 3 years. I love
        capturing my subjects essence and telling a story in a single frame. I
        mostly shoot with other artists because the part I find joy in is the
        creation and collaboration. Being able to connect with other artists and
        bring our minds and bodies together is one of the most beautiful parts
        of it all. I am so grateful to have experienced so many different parts
        of the industry throughout my life. I could not imagine life without
        those moments of emotional and artistic expression. I have learned so
        much about humans and the world through art. I honestly feel it teaches
        you everything you need to know about yourself. Art brought me to where
        I am today and I would not be me without it.
